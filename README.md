🔐 Random Password Generator using Python 💻

I recently completed a small yet impactful project — Random Password Generator — built using Python.

This project focuses on enhancing cybersecurity awareness by creating a tool that generates strong, random passwords with a mix of:
✔️ Uppercase & lowercase letters
✔️ Numbers
✔️ Special characters

The generator ensures that every password is unique, secure, and unpredictable, showcasing how Python can be applied to solve real-world security problems.

**Key Learnings:**
🔹 Using the random and string libraries in Python
🔹 Understanding randomness and character manipulation
🔹 Writing reusable and efficient code
🔹 Enhancing logic-building & coding confidence

**Tech Stack:**
🐍 Python
📦 random, string libraries
💻 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

This project strengthened my Python fundamentals while giving me hands-on experience in writing practical code for daily use cases like password generation.
